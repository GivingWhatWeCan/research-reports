Tackling malaria though distribution of long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) is a highly cost-effective intervention in the developing world. Of the many malaria charities, we particularly recommend [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/against-malaria-foundation/) (AMF).

AMF’s program has a strong track record of preventing malarial infections. It is also highly cost-effective, as its lean organisational structure, careful use of technology and partnerships with local charities keep its costs exceptionally low. Administrative costs are paid by established private donors, and the costs of distribution are covered by its distribution partners. This means that donations from the public go straight towards purchasing more nets. AMF’s website lists all donations received and links each donation to a specific distribution, so donors can follow its progress and see the impact that they are having.

AMF’s emphasis on preparation, distribution, and follow-up ensures that it realises its potential in combating malaria and its effects. Delivering a net costs only $5 -$7.5 donated depending on location (including the costs of its distribution partners), and it is estimated that the life of a child is saved for each $2,838 donated[^fn-1][^fn-2], as well as additional co-benefits[^fn-3]. For comparison, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) will spend up to £20,000 (over $30,000) for a single year of healthy life saved[^fn-4].

## What is malaria?

Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted via the malaria-infected Anopheles mosquitoes. When the mosquitoes bite, the parasites are transported through the human body to the liver, where they multiply and infect red blood cells. Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, and vomiting, and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite. If untreated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening as it disrupts the blood supply to vital organs.

## How does it affect people?

According to the World Health Organisation, there were about 214 million cases of malaria in 2015, and 438,000 deaths[^fn-5]. Due to diagnostic limitations, malaria incidence is hard to assess[^fn-6] and the total number of deaths could be as high as 1 million[^fn-7].

In the developing world, malaria accounts for about 10% of all deaths of children under the age of 5 (see figure 1). If neonatal mortality is excluded, this figure rises to about 25%.[^fn-8] As well as mortality, malaria is strongly associated with anemia[^fn-9], malnutrition[^fn-10], low birthweight[^fn-11], and epilepsy[^fn-12]. The most deadly strain of malaria, P. falciparum is particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa.

There is some evidence suggesting that survivors of malaria earn substantially less over their lifetime[^fn-13][^fn-14].

## How can you address the problem?

Malaria control is carried out through a combination of interventions such as bednet distribution, case management, preventive treatment, indoor residual spraying, and mosquito population control[^fn-17]. Of these, it seems that insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) are the best opportunity for donors due to their cost-effectiveness, and strong track record of achieving results. Recent research suggests that anti-malarial interventions have prevented about 663 million malarial fevers from 2000-2015\. Long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets stand out as being particularly effective — being responsible for around 68% of the malaria reduction. This means that bednets have prevented around 450 million cases of malaria[^fn-18]. Globally, 6.2 million fewer people died of malaria over the last 15 years because of malaria interventions[^fn-19].

## Distribution of insecticide treated bednets

### How does it work?

An insecticide treated net (ITN) is a net, usually intended to be hung over the bed at night. As the mosquitoes responsible for spreading the virus usually feed at night, this provides a high level of protection against infection. ITNs are treated with insecticides which kill mosquitos and are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets at reducing infections[^fn-20]. Long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) are nets designed to remain effective for longer periods without retreatment.

Distribution of ITNs is undertaken by Ministries of Health, NGOs, and distribution partners. Activities include a pre-distribution survey to assess need, delivery of LLINs, promoting the use of LLINs, and post-distribution surveys to monitor usage.

You can read our extensive 2015 update on AMF and the effectiveness of LLINs [here](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-04-24/update-against-malaria-foundation)

### Tractability

#### Narrow cost-effectiveness

The effectiveness of LLIN distribution in reducing malaria prevalence is uncontroversial[^fn-21]. A Cochrane meta-study, which consolidated high quality randomised controlled trials on LLINs, found that, for each 1,000 children protected with a net for a year, 5.53 deaths were averted. This result was broadly consistent across a range of different settings[^fn-22]. The author of this study has suggested that further RCTs on ITN effectiveness would be unethical, as it would be denying the control group a treatment which is known to be beneficial[^fn-23].

 Extrapolating from these figures, Givewell estimate that it would cost $2,833 to save a life (this includes distribution and monitoring costs) by donating to the Against Malaria Foundation[^fn-24]. This suggests that LLIN distributions are one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available to philanthropists.

#### Positive wider impacts

As well as reducing infant mortality, LLIN distribution has a number of co-benefits:

**Malaria is a risk factor for other conditions -** In addition to reducing infant mortality, prevention strategies also relieve a substantial burden of morbidity. There is strong evidence linking malaria in infants or pregnant women with high levels of anemia[^fn-25], malnutrition[^fn-26] low birthweight[^fn-27], and epilepsy[^fn-28]. More recent studies have also suggested a link with HIV[^fn-29] and high blood pressure in children[^fn-30], although this is more uncertain.

**LLINs also protect from other infections** - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by parasitic worms. Severe disfigurement is a common symptom[^fn-31]. Crucially, LF is transmitted by the same type of mosquito as malaria. Evidence suggests that bednet distribution is also effective at reducing prevalence of LF[^fn-32]. For this reason, Nigeria has recently launched the first nationwide lymphatic filariasis and malaria co-implementation plan, which incorporates distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets[^fn-33].

**[Economic benefits of malaria eradication](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2016/01/the-economic-benefits-of-malaria-eradication/)** - there is a growing body of evidence that having malaria as a child has a substantial impact on future earnings[^fn-34]. One influential study reported a 25% increase in future earnings for areas in which malaria was eradicated in Latin America and a 12% increase in the USA[^fn-35]. A more recent study which has higher external validity due to its focus on Sub-Saharan Africa estimated the gains at between 3% and 11%[^fn-36].

#### Possible offsetting/negative impacts

We are confident that LLIN distribution does not have a substantial disruptive effect on the wider economic and health system. We address some common concerns here.

**Does free bednet distribution disrupt private markets?** - We believe that there is a strong argument in favour of distributing bednets for free (as recommended by the WHO) rather than charging for them for two reasons. First, bednets do not only benefit the user but also others in their community by reducing the rate of infection. Second, evidence shows that charging even small amounts for bednets decreases usage by about 75%[^fn-37].

**Insecticide resistance** -  resistance in mosquitoes has been reported in 53 of 65 reporting countries around the world since 2010[^fn-38]. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that ITNs are still more effective than nets that are not treated with insecticides regardless of resistance[^fn-39] and distributing nets remains a cost-effective health intervention, even in areas with strong insecticide resistance[^fn-40].

**Do people misuse bednets?** - A recent article in the New York Times claimed that many bednets were being used for fishing. This would cause harm to fish stock due to the nets’ insecticides and fine gauges.[^fn-41] However, a comprehensive analysis of 14 surveys in several countries with 14,196 households showed that that the overwhelming majority of nets were used for malaria prevention, and only 255 nets were repurposed (which make up less than 1% overall). Furthermore, the majority of the repurposed nets were already considered too torn, indicating they had already served out their useful life for malaria prevention.[^fn-42]

**Does providing bednets displace government funding?** Given that all distributed nets in Malawi were funded by international donors, and there remains a net gap[^fn-43], it seems unlikely that nets would be provided by the government without international aid.

**Do distributions divert skilled labor from other areas?** Bednet distribution is normally undertaken with the assistance of low level government officials (rather than the limited supply of skilled medical practitioners) and completed within a week.[^fn-44] We do not believe that the diversion of skilled labor is significant.

### Neglectedness

The WHO’s ‘Roll Back Malaria’ Harmonization Working group has recently updated their estimates of the net gap for 2015[^fn-45]. They estimate that there still exists a gap of about 49 Million nets in Africa, which translates to a funding gap of about 315 Million dollars for 2015 (see Table 1)[^fn-46].

We therefore conclude that there is substantial room for more funding in the distribution of LLINs.
